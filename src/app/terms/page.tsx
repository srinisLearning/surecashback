          The terms and conditions contained hereinafter (“TERMS OF USE”) shall
          apply to the use of the website www.surecashback.com and all its
          associated websites and APP’s and any other linked pages, products,
          software(s), API keys, features, content or application services
          (including but without limitation to any mobile application services)
          in connection therewith, offered from time to time by GOOD LIFES
          E-COMMERCE SOLUTION PRIVATE LIMITED (“SURE
          CASHBACK” or “WE” or “OUR” or “US”)
          (collectively, &quot;WEBSITE&quot;). Any person logging on to or using
          the Website or APP (even when such person does not avail of any
          services provided in the Website (“SERVICES”)) (hereinafter referred
          to as a “USER”, “YOU”, or CLIENT) shall be presumed to have read these
          Terms of Use (which includes the Privacy Policy, separately provided
          on the Website) and unconditionally accepted the terms and conditions
          set out herein. These Terms of Use constitute a binding and
          enforceable agreement between the User and SURE CASHBACK. These Terms
          of Use do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other
          written agreement you may have with SURE CASHBACK for other services.
          Please read the terms set out hereunder carefully before agreeing to
          the same. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use (including any
          referenced policies or guidelines), please immediately terminate your
          use of the Website or APP. You can accept the Terms of Use by
          <ul>
            <ol>
              Clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Use, where this option
              is made available to you by SURE CASHBACK in the User interface
              for any particular Service; or
            </ol>
            <ol>
              Accessing, testing or actually using the Services. In this case,
              you understand and agree that SURE CASHBACK will treat your use of
              the Services as acceptance of the Terms of Use from that point
              onwards.
            </ol>

        <p>
          For the purpose of these Terms of Use, wherever the context so
          requires, the term “User” shall mean and include any natural or legal
          person who has agreed to these Terms of Use on behalf of itself or any
          other legal entity. It is clarified that the Privacy Policy (that is
          provided separately), form an integral part of these Terms of Use and
          should be read contemporaneously with the Terms of Use. Illegality or
          unenforceability of one or more provisions of these Terms of Use shall
          not affect the legality and enforceability of the other terms of the
          Terms of Use. For avoidance of doubt, if any of the provisions becomes
          void or unenforceable, the rest of the provisions of these Terms of
          Use shall be binding upon the User. The Terms of Use may be revised or
          altered by us at our sole discretion at any time without any prior
          intimation to the User. The latest Terms of Use will be posted here.
          Any such changes by SURE CASHBACK will be effective immediately. By
          continuing to use this Website or APP to access the Services / usage
          of our Services after changes are made, you agree to be bound by the
          revised/ amended Terms of Use and such amendments shall supersede all
          other terms of use previously accepted by the User. You are solely
          responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws
          of your specific jurisdiction that may be applicable to you in
          connection with your business and use of our Services.
